 	As you've already known, my name is Volodymyr Krokhmalnyi.I was born in Lviv on the 6 of June.
 	I studied in the school â„– 90, which I finished in 2009.
 	I graduated from Lviv Polytechnic National University in 2014.
	I work on company named Tickets.UA, we work with companies in many countries.
	This is a good experience to speak with people, find new friends, learn control yourself, of course to receive a bit of extra money.
